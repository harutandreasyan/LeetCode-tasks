    Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:
    
                        Symbol       Value
                        I             1
                        V             5
                        X             10
                        L             50
                        C             100
                        D             500
                        M             1000

    Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place
    values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a
    Roman numeral has the following rules:

    If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal
    value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the
    result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
    If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one
    symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less
    than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following
    subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD)
    and 900 (CM).
    Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most
    3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L),
    or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times
    use the subtractive form.
    
    
    Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

    Example 1:
    Input: num = 3749
    Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
    Explanation:
    3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
    700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
    40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
    9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
    Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion
    is based on decimal places
    
    Example 2:                       Example 3:
    Input: num = 58                  Input: num = 1994
    Output: "LVIII"                  Output: "MCMXCIV"
    Explanation:                     Explanation:
    50 = L                           1000 = M
    8 = VIII                         900 = CM
                                     90 = XC
                                     4 = IV   

    Constraints:
        1 <= num <= 3999
